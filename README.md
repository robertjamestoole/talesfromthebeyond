# SpookySh*tandTalesfromtheBeyondPodcast
This is a simple podcast website to link to new episodes and social media all off site.

This podcast website was a project I did for a group of friends that wanted a simple and minimal website that their listeners could visit.
The main idea was a place listeners could pop in and check out the newest episodes with links to other social media accounts. 

Ideally in the future I will update this website to something like gatsby so that it remains static but is able to be updated some what live with more information on the website like new postings or a blog built right into the website.
I've not done that this time around as I am not super confident with gatsby and react yet but I think it would be a great solution to making a more comprehensive website that has more of what the group would want in a website in the future.
